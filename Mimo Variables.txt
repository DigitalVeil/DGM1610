                                                                                                                                                                Variables
Computers can retain information if we tell them to; to accomplish this, computers use something called variables. 
Variables are like boxes, they can store information and be organized by name to tell us the contents that are inside of them. 

                                                                                                                                                            Creating Variables
To create a variable, we use the term "var" followed by a name. 
 e.g: varfriend 
    
    It is important to note that there are NO spaces between the words to create a variable. In addition, variable names will generally contain capital letters for each word in succession of the first, which is ALWAYS LOWERCASE.

                                                                                                                                                          Assigning Values to Variables
Now that we know how to create a variable, we should start assigning values for them to store. 

To give our "friend" variable information to store we would write as follows. 
eg: varfriend = "Peter";

To display this variable, we use the Console that we learned about earlier. 
var friend = "Peter";
Console.Writeline (friend);

This code would output the variable stored in friend, "Peter", to the console output.
