"Console": A tool used by developers to get feedback for code

e,.g: Console.WriteLine (     );

The above code will display what is contained within the parentheses in a Console Output box. 

e.g: Console.Writeline (Hello, World!);

The code must be written in the correct order in order to function, followed by a semicolon ";"

1: Console 2: Writeline 3: (Insert Test Here) 4: semicolon ";" = Console.Writeline (Hello, World!);

The semicolon is used in the C# language to say that an instruction is over

Parentheses are used to tell our computer that we want something to be done with the information provided

Codes are run line by line and our Computers carry out their instructions.
