                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Boolean

Boolean values differ from strings and numbers in that they CAN ONLY BE TRUE or FALSE.

e.g: 

var newGame = true;
Console.Writeline = (newGame);

The code written above would output TRUE. 

Most of the time, booleans are obtained by comparing values and variables with each other.  
We can use two equal signs (==) to check if two values are the same. 

e.g: 

Console.Writeline = ("Apples" == "Oranges"); 

The code written above would output FALSE. 

Console.Writeline = ("Apples" == "Apples"); 

The code written above would output TRUE. 

We can store the results of these comparisons in VARIABLES. 

e.g:

var result = "Apples" == "Oranges";
Console.Writeline = (results);

The code written above would output FALSE. 

There is a big difference between "=" and "==". We use "=" to STORE VALUES and "==" to COMAPRE them. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Different Boolean Strings 

We can also check if two strings are NOT the same. The operator used for this is called not equals, signified as "!="

e.g: 
var result = "Apples" != "Oranges";
Console.Writeline= (result); 

The code written above would output TRUE. 

var result = "Apples" != "Apples"; 
Console.Writeline = (result);

The code written above would output FALSE. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Comparing Numbers

We can use "==" and "!=" to compare pretty much any type, including numbers. 

e.g: 
Console.Writeline = (1 == 10);

The code written above would output FALSE. 

Console.Writeline = (10 == 10);

The code written above would output TRUE. 

var result = 1 != 10; 
Console. Writeline = (result); 

The code written above would output TRUE. 

However, we can also figure out HOW numbers differ from each other using the greater than ">" or less than "<" signs. 

e.g: 

var result = 1 < 10;
Console.Writeline = (result);

The code written above would output TRUE. 

var result = 1 > 10;
Console.Writeline = (result);

The code written above would output FALSE.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Comparing variables

We are not only limited to values, though. We can also use variables. 

e.g: 

var number = 1;
var result = number == 10;
Console.Writeline = (result); 

The code written above would output FALSE. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Applying Concepts 

With this knowledge, we already know how to check if a PASSWORD IS CORRECT

var password = "Swordfish";
var loggedIn = password == "Swordfish";
Console.Writeline = (loggedIn);

The code written above would output TRUE. 

This is how code checks passwords.
